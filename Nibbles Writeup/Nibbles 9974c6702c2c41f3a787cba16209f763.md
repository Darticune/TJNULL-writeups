# Nibbles

# Recon

## Machine IP Setup

First, we setup the target IP and run AutoRecon on it:

```bash
export IP=10.10.10.75
```

```bash
autorecon $IP -v
```

## Initial Results

The initial results we obtain are as follows:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled.png)

The Ports that are open are:

- 22: ssh - OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
- 80: http - Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))

## Full Results

Further scanning showed no other ports

# Enumeration

Since port 80 is available, we can attempt to look at the feroxbuster output that is automatically run with AutoRecon:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%201.png)

However, it seems like nothing was found on feroxbuster. Therefore, we can take a look at the website itself via the IP on the browser:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%202.png)

We see that there is only Hello World! on the page, so we can take a look at the page source:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%203.png)

Here we see that there is a comment, indicating that there might be a subdirectory named nibbleblog. Navigating to it (http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog), we see that it seems to be a blog:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%204.png)

To enumerate this website, we can run feroxbuster again, including the subdirectory this time:

```bash
feroxbuster -u http://10.10.10.75:80/nibbleblog/ -t 10 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -x "txt,html,php,asp,aspx,jsp" -v -k -n -q -o "/home/kali/results/10.10.10.75/scans/tcp80/blog_tcp_80_http_feroxbuster_big.txt"
```

The results we got are as follows:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%205.png)

We have a lot of interesting results, but we can first take a look at README:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%206.png)

This indicates that this website was taken off nibbleblog.com, which is off the shelf software. Hence, we can look for exploits that have been found online via google:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%207.png)

The first result we hit is a shell upload. Taking a closer look at it, we see: 

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%208.png)

This likely means that we have to somehow get admin credentials and access admin.php.

When trying to access the various links found with feroxbuster, we hit a bunch of deadends, but one of the places that might hold some clues about the admin credentials is /nibbleblog/content:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%209.png)

Enumerating through it, we can see a variety of of pages in the directories, but /nibbleblog/content/private/users.xml has a piece of information that might be useful to us:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2010.png)

This likely means that the username for admin is "admin". Enumerating the other files seemed to yield no other results, so we can perhaps attempt to guess the password for admin by visiting /nibbleblog/admin.php: 

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2011.png)

Trying "admin:admin" and "admin:password" did not work, but "admin:nibbles" let us in:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2012.png)

From there, we can attempt to exploit the vulnerability we found by uploading a php reverse shell to the My image plugin.

# Initial Foothold

Navigating to the plugin page, we see:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2013.png)

Clicking on configure for the My image plugin, we see:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2014.png)

Therefore, we can get a php-reverse shell from pentestmonkey (at [https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell)) and upload it after changing the IP and Port number to that of your attacker machine. From there, we save the file php-reverse-shell.php, and upload it to the file attachment part as instructed by the vulnerability we found.

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2015.png)

After clicking on save changes, we can start a listener using nc:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2016.png)

From there, we have to navigate to the uploaded script to run it. From the exploit explanation we found, we know that we can visit it at:

```bash
http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php
```

Once we visit the page, we see on our listener that we have shell:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2017.png)

However, this is a low privileged shell that cannot cd to home:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2018.png)

Using the “which” command, we see that we have python3:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2019.png)

So we can run:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2020.png)

This gives us a partially interactive bash shell. 

To get a fully interactive shell, background the session (CTRL+ Z) and run the following in your terminal which tells your terminal to pass keyboard shortcuts to the shell.

```bash
stty raw -echo
```

Once that is done, run the command “fg” to bring netcat back to the foreground:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2021.png)

With that done, we have shell:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2022.png)

# User Flag

To find the user flag, we can simply cd to home and use the find command:

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2023.png)

# Root Flag

To escalate privileges, we can first run the following command to see what we can execute as sudo:

```bash
sudo -l
```

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2024.png)

The output above indicates that we can run the script [monitor.sh](http://monitor.sh) as root. 

However if we try to navigate to that file, it doesn't exist: 

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2025.png)

To make all the directories in the path, we can run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir personal
cd personal
mkdir stuff
cd stuff
```

As we can run the shell script as root, we can make the script spawn a shell, which will inherit these root privileges. We create a file [monitor.sh](http://monitor.sh) with the following contents:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
bash
```

Then we give it execute rights and run the shell script as sudo:

```bash
chmod +x monitor.sh
sudo ./monitor.sh
```

![Untitled](Nibbles%209974c6702c2c41f3a787cba16209f763/Untitled%2026.png)

Once again, we cd to home and use the find command to find the root flag:

# Learning Points (Additional Points)

- Exploits for off the shelf software can be found via google
- "can't access tty; job control turned off": indicates a dumb shell where we do not have full interactiveness because nc was never meant to be used to do full interactive shell
    - python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
    - Ctrl + z
    - stty raw -echo
    - fg
- Cannot upgrade dumb reverse shell into full shell in kali easily because Kali uses zsh by default instead of bash:
    - [https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/251326/upgrading-a-reverse-shell-with-stty-raw-echo-doesnt-work](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/251326/upgrading-a-reverse-shell-with-stty-raw-echo-doesnt-work)
    - To fix, run `exec bash --login`
